// 1. What is Sainsbury's annual revenue in billions?
// Sainsbury's annual revenue in billions is approximately 0.8.
// 2. What is Tesco's annual revenue in billions?
// Tesco's annual revenue in billions is approximately 2.
// 3. What is 10^6 in binary?
// The decimal representation of 10^6 is 1000. The binary representation of 1000 is 11111110.

// Then, we represent these answers in Datalog:
// 1. Sainsbury's annual revenue in billions is approximately 0.8.
.decl Annual_Revenue_in_Billions(Sainsbury:symbol, Billion:float)
Annual_Revenue_in_Billions("Sainsbury", "0.8").
// 2. Tesco's annual revenue in billions is approximately 2.
.decl Annual_Revenue_in_Billions(Tesco:symbol, Billion:float)
Annual_Revenue_in_Billions("Tesco", "2").
// 3. What is 10^6 in binary?
// The decimal representation of 10^6 is 1000. The binary representation of 1000 is 11111110.
.decl Binary_Representation(Dec:float, Bits:list(bool))
Binary_Representation(1000, ["1"("00")*binary2list("11111110")]).

// Now, we derive the final answer: Could Sainsbury's buy Tesco?
// The answer is Yes only if Sainsbury's annual revenue is at least twice Tesco's annual revenue.
