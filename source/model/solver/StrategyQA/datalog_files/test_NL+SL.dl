// 1. What is the value of Sainsbury's?
// Sainsbury's has a value of £17.6 billion.
// 2. What is the value of Tesco?
// Tesco has a value of £25.6 billion.
// 3. What is the maximum amount that Sainsbury's can afford to buy Tesco?
// Sainsbury's can afford to buy Tesco only if the value of Sainsbury's is less than or equal to the value of Tesco.

// Then, we represent these answers in Datalog:
// 1. Sainsbury's has a value of £17.6 billion.
.decl Has_value(Company:symbol, Value:float)
Has_value("Sainsbury's", 17.6).
// 2. Tesco has a value of £25.6 billion.
Has_value("Tesco", 25.6).
// 3. Sainsbury's can afford to buy Tesco only if the value of Sainsbury's is less than or equal to the value of Tesco.
Sainsbury's can afford Tesco if and only if Has_value("Sainsbury's", value1), Has_value("Tesco", value2), value1 <= value2.

// Now, we derive the final answer: Could Sainsbury's buy Tesco?
// The answer is Yes only if Sainsbury's has enough money to buy Tesco.
